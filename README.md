This program takes advantage of multiple classes to allow the user to input information about a TV (Price, Brand, Screen Size) and outputs a chart with all of the information for viewing. 

Here is a quick test of the program:

Use Cases: 

 - Website item checkout comparison
 - Learning how to use multiple classes
 - Backend class calling

Problems: 

 - I do not see any logical or runtime errors with this program other than having to enter in everything as an Integer or a String. 

Possible Work Arounds:

 - Allow the user to enter in variables as double or a float instead of an int.
